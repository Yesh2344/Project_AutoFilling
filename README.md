# Smart Autofill Chrome Extension

A lightweight Chrome extension that automatically detects and fills web forms with your saved personal data, similar to Google's built-in autofill but fully customizable. Perfect for streamlining repetitive tasks like filling out forms for job applications, signups, or online shopping.

## Features

* **Form Detection**: Automatically identifies input fields on any webpage.
* **Custom Data**: Save your name, email, phone, and address via a simple popup.
* **Persistent Storage**: Uses Chrome's storage.sync to keep your data across sessions.
* **Dynamic Support**: Handles dynamically loaded forms (e.g., single-page apps) with a MutationObserver.
* **Simple Matching**: Fills fields based on common naming conventions (e.g., "email", "name").

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Google Chrome browser (or a Chromium-based browser).
* Basic familiarity with Chrome extensions (no advanced coding required to install).
